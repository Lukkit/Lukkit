# Lukkit
Lukkit is currently being rewritten on the 2.0-dev branch.

Lukkit allows developers to create Bukkit plugins quickly and easily using the lua scripting language.

Since it was first release by UnwrittenFun, Lukkit has moved from developer to developer. Although updates have been rolling out from time to time, no one person has been able to continue maintaining Lukkit. However, we are trying to change that. 

UnwrittenFun and jammehcow have made the greatest contributions to Lukkit and we would like to thank them for their work.

The Discord guild has been moved [here](https://discord.gg/2TqbhpB).

## Wiki
Because of the amount of updates and changes that have gone into Lukkit, the old wiki pages have been removed and new documentation is being created. Information in the current wiki is subject to change at any time and may not be reliable as of right now.
